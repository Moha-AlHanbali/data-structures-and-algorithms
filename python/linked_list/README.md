# Singly Linked List

- This Module provides means to create Nodes and Linked Lists and modify them to some extent.

<br>

## Challenge

- To implement new data-sahpe and manipulate it.

<br>

## Approach & Efficiency

- O time and space complexity for (insert) method: O(1)
- O time complexity for (includes() and to_string()) methods: O(n)

<br>

## API

- LinkedList.insert()

        Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

        Arguments:
        value: any

        Return: None


- LinkedList.includes()

        Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

        Arguments:
        value: any

        Return: Boolean

- LinkedList.to_string()

        Returns a formatted string representing all the values in the Linked List.

        Arguments:
        None

        Return: String Output

## Testing Goals

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list.
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.
